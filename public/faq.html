          >Q: How are scores calculated again? You explained it to me once but
          it sounded kinda math-y and I kinda zoned out.</strong
        >
        <p>
          A: Scores are calculated based on the average % difference in Monthly
          Listeners from the most recent calculation of the monthly listeners to
          their "baseline" value which was established when they were drafted.
          So for example if when you drafted your artist they had 100k Monthly
          Listeners and then that increased to 110k Monthly Listeners they would
          earn your team 10 points. Additionally, you are rewarded for loyalty
          to your artists. Your artist's score gets a 5% additional bonus for
          every week the artist stays on your team.

        <strong>Q: My team sucks. Can I change who is on it?</strong>
        <p>
          A: Yes - You can find the add/drop functionality at the bottom of the
          <a href="roster.html">Roster</a> page and those add/drops process in
          real time. All points the artist accrued (or lost) while on your team
          remain as part of your score calculation after they are dropped.
